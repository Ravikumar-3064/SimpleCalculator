                                                              Simple Calculator


🧮 Project Description:
The Simple Calculator is a basic yet powerful application designed to perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as ➕ addition, ➖ subtraction, ✖ multiplication, and ➗ division. It allows users to input two numbers and select the desired operation, instantly displaying the result ⚡ with accuracy and clarity 💯.

This project focuses on creating a smooth and user-friendly interface 🎨 that makes mathematical computation easy and efficient. The calculator can handle invalid inputs 🚫, prevent division-by-zero errors ❗, and reset the screen using a clear button 🔁.
